## Known Limitations ##
- needs 7.5KB ROM and nearly 220B of RAM
- MSP430G2452 code compiles, but doesnÂ´t run properly - stack corruption possibly
- no Repeater Mode
- no Gateway Mode
- energy saving should work in sleep, but not verified yet
- no EEPROM to save Settings leading to:
- -no AutoID - Id must be set in Setup()
- -fixed to metric
- -unsure how AUTOPARENT behaves
